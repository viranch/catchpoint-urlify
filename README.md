Catchpoint URLify
============

Chrome extension to remove onclick javascript actions from anchor tags and replace them with proper href URLs on [Catchpoint](http://www.catchpoint.com/)'s customer portal. This enables the users to open most links in new tab, which is not possible in the vanilla portal.

How to use
==========

Download the zipped extension from [here](https://github.com/viranch/catchpoint-urlify/archive/master.zip) and unzip it somewhere.

Go to <a href="chrome://extensions/">extensions page</a> in Chrome, enable "Developer mode", click on "Load unpacked extension..." and browse to the unzipped folder.

Open stuff in new tab.
